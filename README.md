Enigma Self Evaluation

-Functionality: Meets Expectations
Enigma Class with encrypt and decrypt methods successfully implemented. Encrypt/decrypt command line interfaces successfully implemented.

-Object Oriented Programming: Below Expectations
Everything works, but I do have some repeat code. I had to redo some things last minute, and just ran out of time to try and get rid of repeat code that was used in multiple classes.

-Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: Meets Expectations
Code is mostly properly indented, spaced, and lines are not excessively long. Class, method, variable, and file names follow convention. Some enumerables/data structures chosen are the most efficient tool for a given job, and students can speak as to why those enumerables/data structures were chosen. At least one hash is implemented in a way that makes logical sense.

-Test Driven Development: Meets Expectations or Below Expectations
I have 100% test coverage on SimpleCov but I don't think I tested edge cases, and I'm not sure if I have nearly enough tests but everything works! :)

-Version Control: Meets Expectations
I have done 57 commits and 6 pull requests. I think I had a good work flow, but I did struggle with proper naming of each branch that didn't actually end up matching what I was working on.
